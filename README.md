# Hack4Good - VolunteerBAH Volunteer Management System

## Inspiration
As one of our members is a volunteer of AIC as a Silver Generation Ambassador, we took inspiration from AIC's own VMS, including pain points and good practices, and transferring them to our own VMS.

## What it does
Sign up via Singpass. Access your timeline of upcoming events. View your past events. Request certificates from admins. Enrol in new opportunities.

## How we built it
Frontend: React.js with Material UI, React Chrono
Backend: PostgreSQL, Golang

## Challenges we ran into
Tight time constraints due to our busy schedule. We're a little disappointed that we could not finish the functionalities that we wanted to, but it was a good learning experience!

We also could not get our linkup request to Singpass API approved in time for the signup functionality we intended, but hopefully that will come soon!

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Most components are functional less for linking backend with frontend. It was one of our first few times building a web application and exploring React so we are glad to have learnt alot in the past week!

## What we learned
How to use React, its very useful libraries, using Golang for database storage.

## What's next for VolunteerBAH
Linking backend to frontend for functional API calls and non-dummy data
Installing admin pages
Developing form creation
